# lego-wet-roomba
Lego Mindstorms EV3-based Roomba-like creature that runs around with a wet towel. Won't hit walls and won't fall off.

### Build the Hardware

The file `woomba.lxf` can be opened in [Lego Digital Designer](http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/). (It runs fine under Wine.)

Note: While it can generate a building guide, it is a little silly and sometimes it requires extra dimensions to get the bricks to their place. Just following that generated guide will not work.

### Make the software run

I use [ev3dev](www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/) with Python, not the original LEGO Mindstorms software. You need ev3dev to use my software. Or you can make your own!

Note: Getting ev3dev is not hard, and no dangerous procedures are involved -- you install it on a microSD card, the brick cannot be bricked ;-)

TODO write the software :D

Questions, suggestions, anything? Pull requests are welcome!
